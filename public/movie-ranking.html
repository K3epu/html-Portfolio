<h1>The Best Movies Accordin got Matthew</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr /> 
<h3>Lord of the rings Trilogy</h3>
<p>Jackson’s attention to detail – even before filming began – is second-to-none
Director, Peter Jackson, wanted everything to look as realistic and believable as possible. Hobbiton was built a year in advance of filming to give the impression of real growth and age.
This included planting a vegetable garden and moving 5,000 cubic metres of earth to create roads.</p>
<h3>Star Wars series</h3>
<p>Star Wars became my childhood.
Star Wars became my birthday and Christmas for years. 
It became visits to my grandmother. She would regularly have a new action for me. It was always wrapped in a brown paper bag.  
It became playground games—lightsabers verses lightsabers. 
It became Halloween costumes. 
The music made my four-year-old chest just stick out. I grew muscular and taller listening to opening music.  Star Wars was the world I was in. 
Yes.We all know the cultural phenomenon that it has become. And the huge intellectual property that it has become to Disney. </p>
<h3>Harry Potter</h3>
<p>The Harry Potter movies visualized what book readers had long fantasized about in their heads, and with the creative input and blessing of Rowling, they were able to evolve and grow just as the novels did, with four different directors bringing a variety of flavors to the series from film to film without sacrificing character, story, or continuity. It’s a magnificent accomplishment made all the more impressive by the fact that there’s not an outright bad movie in the bunch.</p>
